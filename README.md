# Py-Flask_Website

A basic website built with Flask for Python

## Getting started

 To use the virtual environment, run the command `venv\Scripts\activate`
 To exit the environment, run the command `deactivate`

 To ensure that Flask is properly set up, run the command `set FLASK_APP=FlaskSite:main` in order to get localhost to run properly. 
 After that, run the command `flask run` to actually run the localhost environment.

 To note, any changes made will require restarting the server
